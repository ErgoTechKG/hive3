# Docker Build and Container Fix Report

**Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Fixed By:** Claude Code  

## Summary
Successfully fixed all Docker build and container runtime issues. All services are now running correctly.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Backend Build Issues
**Problem:** TypeScript compilation was failing due to missing TypeScript compiler
**Solution:** 
- Installed dependencies properly with `npm install`
- Fixed TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json
- Successfully compiled TypeScript to JavaScript

### 2. Frontend Build Issues  
**Problem:** Missing public directory and required files (index.html, manifest.json, robots.txt)
**Solution:**
- Created public directory structure
- Added index.html template for React app
- Added manifest.json for PWA support
- Added robots.txt for SEO

### 3. Environment Configuration
**Problem:** Missing .env file with required environment variables
**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive .env file with all required variables
- Configured MongoDB, Redis, JWT, and application ports
- Added PORT environment variable for proper backend configuration

### 4. Health Check Configuration
**Problem:** Health check was pointing to wrong port and endpoint
**Solution:**
- Updated healthcheck.js to use correct internal port (5000)
- Fixed health endpoint path from /api/v1/health to /health
- Health checks now passing for all containers

## Current Status

### Container Status
```
✅ MongoDB (mongo:7) - Running on port 27017
✅ Redis (redis:7-alpine) - Running on port 6379  
✅ Backend (Node.js/Express) - Running on port 3001 (healthy)
✅ Frontend (React/nginx) - Running on port 3002 (healthy)
```

### Services Configuration
- **MongoDB**: Configured with authentication and persistent storage
- **Redis**: Configured with password authentication
- **Backend**: Successfully built and running with TypeScript compilation
- **Frontend**: Successfully built and serving React application via nginx

## Verification Steps

1. **Check container status:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
   All containers show as running with healthy status

2. **Test backend health:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```
   Returns 200 OK with health status

3. **Test frontend:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3002
   ```
   Returns React application HTML

4. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs
   ```
   All services starting without errors

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
- `/frontend/public/index.html` - React app entry point
- `/frontend/public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- `/frontend/public/robots.txt` - SEO configuration
- `/frontend/public/favicon.ico` - Placeholder favicon
- `/.env` - Environment configuration
- `/backend/src/routes/health.routes.ts` - Health check route

### Modified Files:
- `/backend/healthcheck.js` - Fixed port and endpoint path
- `/.env` - Added PORT variable for backend

## Next Steps

The Docker environment is now fully functional. You can:

1. **Start development:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

3. **Stop services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

4. **Rebuild if needed:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```

## Notes

- Backend runs internally on port 5000 but is exposed on 3001
- Frontend runs internally on port 3000 but is exposed on 3002
- All services are configured with health checks
- Persistent volumes are configured for MongoDB and Redis data
- The application is ready for development and testing
